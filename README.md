# Hello, World! I'm Yeonsu Bak ðŸ‘‹
The earliest time I dreamt of being a programmerâ€”hacker, preciselyâ€”was when I was 10. I surfed the net and tried learning some basics of Computer Science then I quitted it probably it was too difficult. Since then, I was constantly interested in coding but that interest easily went off due to my busy life...

# So, where am I at now ðŸ‘€?
I regained my passion for being a programmer once again after the military service ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·. Recently, I completed a boot camp with a couple of projects and just getting into the journey as a software developer. To all developers, please be my guest ðŸ¤—

# Skills I've used in my projects ðŸš€
- Front-end: React.js, Javascript, TailwindCSS
- Back-end: Spring Framework(Boot & MVC), MySQL, AWS EC2 & RDS, Nginx
- CI/CD: Jenkins
