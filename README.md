# Hello, World! I'm Yeonsu Bak ðŸ‘‹
The earliest time I dreamt of being a programmer--hacker, precisely--is when I was 10. I surfed the net and tried learning some basics of network then I quitted it probably it was too difficult. Since then, I was constantly interested in coding but that interest easily went off due to the busy life...

# So, where am I at now?
I regained my passion of being a programmer once again after the military service :kr:.
